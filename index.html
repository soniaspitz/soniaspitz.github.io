        <h2>This is a call to being less hostile, extreme, and more compassionate</h2>

        <h3>Debate and Social Media</h3>
        <p> 

            In the social media sphere it becomes very easy to access those we disagree with. If one doesn't agree completely
            with you one is able to freely agrue against them. The issue becomes hostility and extremity. They are just words
            and people have <i>little</i> to no effect on any real issues. These heated arguments achieve nothing. Neither
            person becomes more aware of the other side, changes their mind, or convinces anyone of anything. The polarization
            just allows them to affirm themselves in their beliefs.
